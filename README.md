This is a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/product/workers/) that receives webhook notifications from the [FreeStuff API](https://docs.freestuffbot.xyz/) and sends them out to our [Telegram Channels](https://t.me/freestuff_hub).

This also doubles as a demo project on how to use the [FreeStuff API sdk for JS/TS](https://github.com/FreeStuffBot/typescript-api-sdk).
